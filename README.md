##Website Optimization Project for Udacity Front End Nanodegree

I optimized index.html, pizza.html and views/css/style.css with comments that starts with "Alex" on the modifications I made.

###A brief list of things I did:
* Resize and compress the images
* Minify and inline CSS files and add media queries
* Minify the JS files and add async
* Move repeating variable assignment out of for loops
* Use translate3d() to force hardware acceleration
* Reduce the amount of pizzas
